slice potatos thinly and cook gently in lots of oil until they are soft 
and broken. add some onion if you are feeling fancy. mix this mixture 
with eggs in a bowl then pour into a very hot oily pan and stir until 
the egg mixture is mostly cooked through. then allow it to cook through 
and form a solid omelette. finish the top under the grill, or flip it 
over using a plate.
